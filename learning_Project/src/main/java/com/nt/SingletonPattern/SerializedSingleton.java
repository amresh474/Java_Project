/*
Serialization and Singleton
Sometimes in distributed systems, we need to implement Serializable interface in
Singleton class so that we can store its state in the file system and retrieve it at
a later point of time. Here is a small singleton class that implements Serializable interface also.


The problem with serialized singleton class is that whenever we deserialize it,
 it will create a new instance of the class. Let’s see it with a simple program

*/




public class SerializedSingleton {
	
	 private static final long serialVersionUID = -7604766932017737115L;

	    private SerializedSingleton(){}
	    
	    private static class SingletonHelper{
	        private static final SerializedSingleton instance = new SerializedSingleton();
	    }
	    
	    public static SerializedSingleton getInstance(){
	        return SingletonHelper.instance;
	    }

protected Object readResolve() {
    return getInstance();
}

	    
	

}
